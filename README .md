# Farm Management System

A comprehensive farm management solution designed to support various farm operations including user and task management, equipment and inventory control, bookings, vendor management, farm registration with GIS capabilities, and more. The system is built with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure proper authorization.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete users with different roles (Super Admin, Owner, Manager, Field Officer, Farmer)
- **Task Management**: Assign and track tasks with comments and attachments
- **Equipment Management**: Track equipment status, usage records, and maintenance history
- **Bookings Management**: Schedule and manage various types of bookings
- **Inventory Management**: Track inventory items with automatic status updates based on quantity levels
- **Vendor & Purchase Orders**: Manage vendors, create purchase orders, and track communications
- **Farm Registration with GIS**: Register farms with geographic information, draw boundaries on interactive maps, manage farm plots, and track sensors

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Django 4.2+
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL/SQLite
- GDAL (for GIS functionality)
- GeoDjango

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/planeteyeai/farm-management.git
cd farm-management
```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. For GIS functionality, you'll need to install GDAL:
   - On Windows, the easiest way is to use OSGeo4W installer: https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/
   - On macOS: `brew install gdal`
   - On Linux: `sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev`

5. Apply migrations:
